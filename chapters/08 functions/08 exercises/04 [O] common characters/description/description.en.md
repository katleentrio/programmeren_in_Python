Write a function `common_characters` that takes two strings (`str`). The function must return the number of characters (`int`) both strings have in common. Each character is counted only once: the strings `bee` and `tween` only have one character in common (the letter `e`). Uppercase and lowercase letters are considered to be different characters.

### Example

```console?lang=python&prompt=>>>
>>> common_characters('bee', 'tween')
1
```
